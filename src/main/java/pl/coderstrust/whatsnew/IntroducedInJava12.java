    In Java 12 we received new Switch statement. It's creation looks like this example:

    DayOfWeek = day = DayOfWeek.FRIDAY;

    String activity = switch(day) {
        case MONDAY -> "First day of work";
        ...
        default -> "Do nothing";
    }

    However at the moment to use it we need to enable it "use --enable-preview to enable switch rules".
