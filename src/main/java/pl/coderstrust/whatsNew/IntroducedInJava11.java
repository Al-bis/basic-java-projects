    The biggest change in Java 11 was introduction of Java LTS version. Long Term Support will be updated in period of
    few years and next LTS version will be release every 3 years. Oracle JDK version is not free for production use,
    however there is OpenJDK which is free but it is supported only till next Java version. Each new version will
    be released after half year.
    There are also other Java distributions from other vendors like for example Amazon Corretto which is LTS and free.
